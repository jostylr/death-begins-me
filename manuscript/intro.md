I have known Jack Jones for almost twenty years. But for him, yesterday was the first day that he met me, from his perspective. 

All those years ago, he told me something that I found hard to believe. He wanted his story told, but he did not want told too early in his life. He, in fact, had already read this article and thought it was very well done. 

I have to admit that I am still unsure whether he chose me or it just somehow was the way it was always going to be. While I am a fan of science fiction and delighted in time travel stories, I never thought I would be personally involved in such a story. Most of the time, time travel stories do not make much sense. Cause and effect, after all, are so important to our way of thinking that when they cease to be the governing principle, we are quite at a loss. 

And so it was with meeting Jack all those years ago. He laid it all out there in our very first meeting. I did go and learn more from him over time. I met his young children where I could see the immense sadness in his eyes and I went to his wife's funeral where he could hardly suppress his glee. 

Do not judge him on those snippets, however. For you see, his wife's funeral signalled to him that he was going to finally meet his wife. The birth of his children meant he would never see them again. 

For you see, Jack travels through time in the wrong way.
