This is a storing place for ideas as it is hard to figure out the structure of this.

The basic idea is that this is somewhat akin to a New Yorker article, long, winding, a personalized journey of the author conveying the idea of what is being investigated. 

It starts with a teaser of an introduction, a fondness for the individual in question. 

Next comes the first meeting by the reporter. It will roughly be chronological to his point of view. That meeting will involve some revelations and a test. 

Probably in there comes discussion of his "birth" and the strange chronology of relationships. 

But the heart of it is about his wife. Somehow the reporter is involved in that. And the last time he meets Jack, is the day before she dies and he knows it will be the last time he sees her. He does not know how it will happen. This is a point of agony for him. Maybe she is a good friend? I think sister is too much. He is also instructed to take the fellow's journals. Jack only learns about them the day his wife dies. Before then, he is flying blind. Basically, in forward chronology, he looks like he falls apart after his wife's death as opposed to the reality of coming into his own in the backward chronology. 

Birth of the children is important too. 

discussion about his own feelings of his birth -- there is a book for the reporter that details his descent like flowers for algernon. That would be the end of the article.
